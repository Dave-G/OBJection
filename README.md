# OBJection
### Batch OBJ importer for Blender

## About
Blender currently does not support batch imports for OBJ files. This was a huge issue for me, mainly working with large tiled World Machine builds in Blender.
This allows you not only to import multiple OBJ files with your own settings, but to also retain their filenames as object names if desired. 
In a use-case such as World Machine builds, this effectively lets you import an entire tiled world in-tact with one operation.

## Installation
You can install this add-on directly from the Python file like any other Blender add-on. For those unfamiliar with the process, I've included a simple visual guide.

## Usage
After installation, it's as simple as going to the Import menu and selecting the desired files/settings you want.
